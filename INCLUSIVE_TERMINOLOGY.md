# Inclusive Terminology

In our continued efforts to build inclusive communities and software, we recommend the following words be avoided in all projects.

This list should be considered a living artifact, if you have suggestions on words we should consider adding, pleases open an issue. Where possible, we follow the recommendation and processes of the CNCF [Inclusive Naming Initiative](https://inclusivenaming.org/).
